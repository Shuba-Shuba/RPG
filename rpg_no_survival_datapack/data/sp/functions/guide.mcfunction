tellraw @s "RPG Battle is a datapack that adds custom bosses and weapons to the game. Most content in the pack is intended for players with diamond tier, but there are several additions to make transitioning from iron tier to diamond tier easier. The XP and enchanting system has been removed because it has been replaced with the mana system for magic weapons. There are very few magic weapons, but loads of ranged weapons because we are trying to finish all the ranged content to create a baseplate for magic and melee. Have fun!"
